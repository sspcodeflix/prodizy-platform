# Prodizy Platform

## Executive Summary

The Prodizy Platform is an enterprise-grade LLM connector system designed to bridge the gap between large language models and enterprise tools, databases, and knowledge sources. It enables natural language interaction with organizational data and systems, allowing users to query information and execute actions across various enterprise tools through simple, conversational interfaces.

## Business Proposition

### Problem Statement

Organizations struggle to extract value from their diverse data sources and tool ecosystems. Users waste time navigating between different applications, learning specialized interfaces, and manually connecting information across systems. Meanwhile, the potential of LLMs remains largely untapped in enterprise environments due to challenges in securely connecting them with internal systems.

### Our Solution

The Prodizy Platform solves these challenges by:

1. **Creating a unified interface** to enterprise data and tools through natural language
2. **Enabling contextual retrieval** of internal knowledge to enhance LLM responses
3. **Providing secure, controlled execution** of actions across enterprise systems
4. **Maintaining governance and compliance** through invitation-based access and comprehensive authentication

### Value Proposition

- **Productivity Enhancement**: 30-50% reduction in time spent navigating between tools and searching for information
- **Knowledge Democratization**: Makes specialized system knowledge accessible to all employees
- **Process Automation**: Enables execution of multi-step processes through simple natural language requests
- **Decision Support**: Delivers contextual information to support better decision-making
- **Technical Integration**: Reduces the need for custom integrations between tools

## System Architecture

### Architecture Overview

The Prodizy Platform employs a modular architecture that separates concerns between user interaction, decision-making, information retrieval, and system execution. This design enables security, scalability, and extensibility.

### Core Components

#### 1. User Interface Layer

- **Streamlit UI**: Provides a clean, interactive web interface for users to submit natural language queries and view results
- **Actor/User**: Enterprise users who interact with the system through the UI

#### 2. Core Engine Layer

- **Prodizy Platform - Core Engine**: Central orchestration component that manages the flow of information and maintains session state
- **Authentication (AuthN)**: Handles user authentication and authorization based on invitation model
- **Session Store**: Maintains conversation history and context
- **Invitation Store**: Manages access control through invitation-based system

#### 3. Connection Layer

- **LLM Connector Bridge**: Transforms natural language inputs into structured representations for processing
- **Connector Registry**: Maintains catalog of available APIs, endpoints, and their capabilities
- **Schema Store**: Stores discovered API schemas and metadata
- **Schema Discovery Service**: Proactively identifies and catalogs APIs and database schemas

#### 4. Decision Layer

- **Decision System**: Intelligent component that determines the optimal approach to fulfill requests
- **Execution Results Store**: Records outcomes of executed actions for feedback and learning

#### 5. Processing Layer

- **LLM Service**: Handles direct interactions with the underlying language model
- **RAG Engine**: Enhances responses with retrieved information from internal knowledge sources
- **Data Prioritization & Embeddings Generation**: Manages vectorization of enterprise data
- **Vector DB**: Stores embeddings for efficient semantic retrieval

#### 6. External Systems

- **Enterprise Tools**: MLflow, ServiceNow, Jira, Slack, Teams, Confluence, Tableau, etc.
- **Databases**: SQL, NoSQL, Enterprise Datamarts
- **Documentation**: Internal documentation, guides, wikis, etc.

### Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User submits a natural language query through the Streamlit UI
2. **Authentication**: Core Engine verifies user authorization via AuthN and Invitation Store
3. **Query Processing**: LLM Connector Bridge transforms the query for processing
4. **Decision Making**: Decision System determines optimal approach (direct LLM, RAG, API execution)
5. **Execution Path**:
   - For information needs: RAG Engine retrieves relevant context from Vector DB
   - For actions: Connector Registry executes appropriate APIs against enterprise tools
6. **Response Generation**: LLM Service generates human-readable responses
7. **Feedback Loop**: Execution results are stored for system improvement
8. **User Delivery**: Response is delivered back to the user via UI

## Key Features

### MVP-1 Features

1. **Invitation-Based Access Control**: Secure, controlled access to the platform
2. **Basic Enterprise Tool Integration**: Connection to key systems (Jira, Confluence, etc.)
3. **Simple Data Query Capabilities**: Natural language queries against databases
4. **Core RAG Implementation**: Enhanced responses using internal documentation
5. **Schema Discovery**: Basic identification of available APIs and data structures
6. **Vectorization Pipeline**: Initial implementation for embedding generation

### MVP-2 Enhancements (Planned)

1. **Advanced RAG Techniques**: Improved retrieval with multi-vector queries and reranking
2. **Feedback-Driven Learning**: System improvement based on execution outcomes
3. **Enhanced Authentication**: Role-based access control beyond invitation model
4. **Expanded Tool Integrations**: Additional enterprise systems and custom connectors
5. **Automated Action Sequences**: Chain multiple API calls to accomplish complex tasks
6. **User Personalization**: Adapting to individual user preferences and work patterns
7. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Operational visibility for system administrators

## Technical Considerations
